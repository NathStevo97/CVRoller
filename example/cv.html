<span class="cites abstract">In an analysis connecting labor market earnings to college major choices, we find statistically significant relationships between changes in wages by occupation and subsequent changes in college majors completed in related fields of college study between 1982 and 2012. College majors (defined at a detailed level) are most strongly related to wages observed three years earlier, when students were college freshmen. The responses to wages vary depending on the extent to which there is a strong mapping of majors into particular occupations.

<span class="cites abstract">America's diverse higher education landscape includes more than 700 four-year nonprofit colleges and universities that focus on baccalaureate education. These private nondoctoral (PND) institutions are located in almost every state and collectively enroll about 1.6 million students and award nearly 150,000 degrees annually, with the majority of these being bachelor's degrees. As this report will show, these independent colleges and universities are effective and efficient academic enterprises and, as such, are a valuable resource to the states in which they are located, as well as to the nation.</span></p>

<span class="cites abstract">This study examines key aspects of the cost-effectiveness of PND colleges as providers of baccalaureate degrees and explores how states might feasibly make better use of these colleges to produce more degrees efficiently. The study looks at degree production and cost in the PND sector relative to other higher education sectors, focusing on the most comparable public institutions. PND colleges and universities have a 22 percentage point edge over comparable public institutions in four-year graduation rates and a nearly 12 point advantage in six-year graduation rates, and they hold a significant advantage for all subgroups. Moreover, PND colleges retain students initially interested in STEM and health to degrees in those majors at rates (41 percent) approaching twice the rates of public doctoral and nondoctoral institutions (24 and 23 percent, respectively).</span></p>

<span class="cites abstract">Evidence suggests teacher hiring in public schools is ad-hoc and often does not result in good selection amongst applicants. Some districts use structured selection instruments in the hiring process, but we know little about the efficacy of such tools. In this paper we evaluate the ability of applicant selection tools used by the Spokane Public Schools (SPS) to predict three outcomes: measures of teachers' value-added contributions to student learning, teacher absence behavior, and attrition rates. We observe all applicants to the district, both those who are and who are not hired. We find that the screening instruments predict teacher value-added in student achievement and teacher attrition, but not teacher absences.</span></p>

<span class="cites abstract">Economists offer two major explanations for the fact that we find causal labor market returns to education. The first is human capital accumulation: education improves ability. The second is signaling: education allows initially high-ability students to distinguish themselves. A major point of interest in the economics of education is relative contributions of signaling and human capital. Empirical evidence generally excludes the trivial case: neither human capital nor signaling explain either 0% or 100% of the return. I argue that exclusions of the trivial case form the limits of what can be learned from empirical data. An education returns model with some non-zero contribution of both signaling and human capital cannot be empirically distinguished from another model with different non-zero contributions, making human capital vs. signaling a poor framing for understanding the return as a whole, and for policy decision-making.</span></p>

<span class="cites abstract">Many college students in the United States take longer than the proscribed four years to complete their bachelor's degrees. Long time-to-degree leads to billions of dollars of additional costs in higher education in the form of education costs and lost wages. Time-to-degree can be reduced if students to take more credits each term. However, an increased course load may lead students to reduce their time investment in each course, harming performance. Using longitudinal data on two cohorts of students at a regional four-year university with a high average time-to-degree, we fail to find any evidence that a high course load has a negative impact on student performance in class. This result is consistent with a model where students substitute time away from non-education activities when their course loads increase.</span></p>

CSU Fullerton Department of Economics Working Paper 2018/006.</span> <span class="cites extra"><a href="https://business.fullerton.edu/department/economics/assets/CSUF_WP_6-18.pdf?_=0.5066671690928286">PDF</a></span><br />
<span class="cites abstract">Prior studies find that undergraduate major choices are responsive to earnings associated with those majors, but weakly suggests that responsiveness has dropped over time. Using data on college graduates from 1973 to 2013, we find that responsiveness of major choice to labor market returns has weakened over time. The weakening response is due to changes within demographic groups rather than demographic changes in the college graduate population over time. If the goal is to maintain or increase the alignment between college major and labor market returns, incentivizing undergraduates to select high-earning majors is necessary.</span></p>
<p><span class="cites cite">&quot;Student Preference for Guidance and Complexity in College Major Requirements&quot; with Rachel Baker. CEPA Working Paper 04/2018 and CSU Fullerton Department of Economics Working Paper 2018/005.</span> <span class="cites extra"><a href="https://cepa.stanford.edu/content/student-preference-guidance-and-complexity-college-major-requirements">PDF</a></span><br />
<span class="cites abstract">In order to graduate with a bachelor's degree, students must determine which classes they must take in order to satisfy the requirements of their major. These requirements are often complex and difficult to comprehend, leading to some policy interventions that aim to reduce complexity by either increasing the amount of student guidance in course choice or by reducing the amount of complexity-increasing choice. We perform two student preference experiments on students at two large four-year universities to determine how students might respond to increasing guidance or reduced choice in their course-taking options. We find that students do not respond strongly to increases in guidance such as grouping courses into meaningful categories or removing cross-cutting requirements, but strongly reject a reduction in options, even when given a rationale for the reduction. These results suggest that increased-guidance policies have some avenues to operate in without student push-back, but that strong reductions in choice are unlikely to be popular.</span></p>
<p><span class="cites cite">&quot;Keeping an Eye Out: Behavior in the Presence of Riskless Ambiguity.&quot; CSU Fullerton Department of Economics Working Paper 2018/001.</span> <span class="cites extra"><a href="http://nickchk.com/Huntington-Klein_2018_Keeping_an_Eye_Out.pdf">PDF</a></span><br />
<span class="cites abstract">Past research on choice under ambiguity - decisions made when the probability of each outcome is unknown - has typically focused on scenarios in which ambiguity is presented alongside risks with known probabilities. Understanding the response to ambiguity is then difficult to distinguish from the response to risk, confounding our understanding of how subjects behave in conditions of ambiguity. In this paper I take advantage of the fact that all decisions are necessarily ambiguous to some extent to develop a scenario in which ambiguity is present but is otherwise risk-free. Respondents participate in a task that is very similar to a multi-armed bandit but with no random variation in payouts. I show that respondents anticipate ambiguity in payouts without prompting, continue to do so for long periods of time, respond differently to gains and losses in this context, and that this tendency is independent of risk preference. I offer a basic, clean framework for creating a riskless ambiguous environment for subjects, and argue that these exploratory results make the case for further study of ambiguity in riskless environments.</span></p>
<p><span class="cites cite">&quot;Most Likely to Succeed: Personality and Long-Run Economic Outcomes&quot; with Elaina Rose.</span> <span class="cites extra"></span><br />
<span class="cites abstract">We estimate the effect of college seniors' personality traits on long-run career and economic outcomes. The analysis uses a novel data set that merges information from the 1980 - 1984 West Point yearbooks with detailed alumni records. Personality traits were inferred from peer-written narratives and faculty-conferred distinctions. The narratives were evaluated by West Point alumni from non-study classes and the multiple reports were aggregated using a Latent Class Model (LCM). We find that cadets identified by faculty as leaders, and those characterized by peers as leaders, determined, or social prove to be more successful in terms of military and civilian career outcomes 31-35 years after graduation.</span></p>
