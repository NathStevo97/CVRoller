%followed by other information, notably the CV data itself
file: cvdata.xlsx

%Each section is marked by two hash tags ##, then the name of the section
##head
%The type of the section tells the theme how to style it
%And also there are a few special section types CVRoller treats differently: head, date, text.
%Note that type is already the section name by default 
type: head
%A format option tells CVRoller how to construct each item out of its constituent parts.
format: "{photo}{name}\br{position}, {institution}\br{email}, {phone}\br{website}, Twitter: @{twitter}, GitHub: {github}"
%Note this format option wouldn't work for the moderncv version, but moderncv ignores a head type's format argument anyway.

%The title is by default the section name, so no need to do "employment" and then title: Employment
%Note that it DOES need to match the section name in the data file, but that's not case sensitive
##Employment
%Don't want this in the web version
version: pdf, wd, markdown, pdffiletheme

##Education
%Indent here is actually kind of ugly, just want to demonstrate it for the moderncv version.
%The @pdf indicates that this option only applies to the version named pdf.

##cites
title: Academic Publications
%A bib option uses a BibTeX library (either in .bib form, or JSON form), then points to a .csl citation style
%which can also be a citation style at zotero.com.
bib: publications.bib, chicago-author-date-16th-edition.csl
%Subtitles are allowed
%Note the use here (and in other places) of Markdown formatting for things like links, images, etc.
subtitle@web: "Please email me at [nhuntington-klein@fullerton.edu](mailto:nhuntington-klein@fullerton.edu) for working PDFs if not linked."
subtitle@markdown: "Please email me at [nhuntington-klein@fullerton.edu](mailto:nhuntington-klein@fullerton.edu) for working PDFs if not linked."
%the bib option will store the formatted citation as a {raw} attribute, and it can be accessed by the format option in that way.

format@markdown: "{raw} [Link]({url}). {note}\br{abstract}\br"
