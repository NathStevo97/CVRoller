%WORTH NOTING! This layout file is a complex mess!
%That's because it serves as an example file to show off every single bell and whistle CVRoller has.
%The file I use for my actual CV, and the file you'll write for yours, are MUCH BETTER!
%This section lays out the versions and their options
version: web
    out: cv.html
	%Note that sectiondivider in the defaulttheme.txt file is on by default, this is just for illustration
	%Also note that defaulttheme.txt (without any options changed) is the same theme that is used when no theme is specified, hardcoded in CVRoller.
	theme: defaulttheme.txt, sectiondivider=on
version: pdf
    out: "HuntingtonKleinCV.pdf"
	theme: banking, fontfamily=serif
	%processor defaults to pdflatex anyway
	processor: pdflatex
version: pdffiletheme
	out: "BasicPDFCV.pdf"
theme: defaultpdftheme.txt
version: wd
    out: "WordCV.docx"
version: markdown
	out: "cv.md"

%followed by other information, notably the CV data itself
file: cvdata.xlsx

%Each section is marked by two hash tags ##, then the name of the section
##head
%The type of the section tells the theme how to style it
%And also there are a few special section types CVRoller treats differently: head, date, text.
%Note that type is already the section name by default 
type: head
%A format option tells CVRoller how to construct each item out of its constituent parts.
format: "{photo}{name}\br{position}, {institution}\br{email}, {phone}\br{website}, Twitter: @{twitter}, GitHub: {github}"
%Note this format option wouldn't work for the moderncv version, but moderncv ignores a head type's format argument anyway.

%The title is by default the section name, so no need to do "employment" and then title: Employment
%Note that it DOES need to match the section name in the data file, but that's not case sensitive
##Employment
%Don't want this in the web version
version: pdf, wd, markdown, pdffiletheme

##Education
%Indent here is actually kind of ugly, just want to demonstrate it for the moderncv version.
%The @pdf indicates that this option only applies to the version named pdf.
type@pdf: indent
version: pdf, wd, markdown, pdffiletheme

##cites
title: Academic Publications

%A bib option uses a BibTeX library (either in .bib form, or JSON form), then points to a .csl citation style
%which can also be a citation style at zotero.com.
bib: file=publications.bib, style=chicago-author-date-16th-edition

%Other ways to get publications in (commented out for now)
%Looking up a list of DOIs:
%doi: doi="10.1111/ssqu.12483;10.1257/pandp.20181114", style="chicago-author-date-16th-edition"
%Using an orcid (fill in with actual id and secret, see Layout Instructions)
%doi: orcid = "0000-0002-7352-3991", style = "chicago-author-date-16th-edition", id = "APIidfromORCID", secret = "secretkeyfromORCID"
%Using pmid or pmcid entries from PubMed (defaults to database = "pubmed", no need to specify that)
%pmid: pmid="4425484;4425485", style = "chicago-author-date-16th-edition", database = "PubMed"
%Or with PMCID:
%pmid: pmcid="2990724;2990725", style = "chicago-author-date-16th-edition", database = "PMC"

%Subtitles are allowed
%Note the use here (and in other places) of Markdown formatting for things like links, images, etc.
subtitle@web: "Please email me at [nhuntington-klein@fullerton.edu](mailto:nhuntington-klein@fullerton.edu) for working PDFs if not linked."
subtitle@markdown: "Please email me at [nhuntington-klein@fullerton.edu](mailto:nhuntington-klein@fullerton.edu) for working PDFs if not linked."
%the bib option will store the formatted citation as a {raw} attribute, and it can be accessed by the format option in that way.
