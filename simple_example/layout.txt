%This section lays out the versions and their options
version: web
    out: cv.html
	theme: defaulttheme.txt
version: pdf
    out: "HuntingtonKleinCV.pdf"
	theme: casual, fontfamily=serif, color=blue
	
%And now load in the file that has all the information that goes on the CV
file: cvdata.xlsx

%Each section is marked by two hash tags ##, then the name of the section
##head

%The type of the section tells the theme how to style it
%And also there are a few special section types CVRoller treats differently: head, date, text.
%Note that type is already the section name by default. types exist so that the theme (whether it's a CSS/HTML theme, moderncv/LaTeX theme, etc.) knows how to style the section!
type: head

%A format option tells CVRoller how to construct each item out of its constituent parts.
%Note that, here, the format argument is only needed for the HTML version; PDF handles the head section's format in its own way.
format: "{photo}{name}\br{position}, {institution}\br{email}, {phone}\br{website}, Twitter: @{twitter}, GitHub: {github}"

%Note that the section name does to match the section name in the data file, but it's not case sensitive. In cvdata.xlsx, employment data is tagged as "employment"
##Employment

%I don't want the employment section in the web version, so I tell it to just be in the PDF.

##cites
%I don't want this section titled "cites". I want it titled "Academic Publications"

subtitle@web: "Please email me at [nhuntington-klein@fullerton.edu](mailto:nhuntington-klein@fullerton.edu) for working PDFs if not linked."

%You can specify that an argument only applies to one of the versions with @. I only want to use this format for the web version, not the PDF (I don't want abstracts in my PDF).
